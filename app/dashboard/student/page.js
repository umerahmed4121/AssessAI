      he main body is the most important part of your answer and is where most of the marks will be gained or lost. When planning the main body, you should be conscious of how well the paragraphs flow on from each other – whilst it’s not always possible to have a completely smooth structure, there should be some sort of logic to the order in which you deal with different points. This is where a failure to plan can really cost you (see Essay Bite 3). If you simply start writing, you are much more likely to produce a poorly structured answer which jumps backwards and forwards between largely unrelated points.

When thinking about planning your main body, it might be helpful to think about paragraphs as individual units of argument. A good general rule is one point = one paragraph. Each paragraph should have a distinct job to do in your essay, be that to provide some background detail or to make a specific point or argument.

Another important thing to think about is paragraph length. Whilst there is no optimum length, it’s definitely possible to have paragraphs that are too long or too short. If you tend to write very long paragraphs, it’s worth checking that you’re not breaking the one point per paragraph rule. Consider splitting the paragraph up in such circumstances, to ensure that each of your points or arguments gets the space to develop fully. More problematic are short paragraphs. These are often easy to spot because you’ll see several short, one or two sentence paragraphs on the same page, almost resembling a series of bullet points rather than fully developed arguments.

One basic way of structuring your main body paragraphs which helps you stick to the one point per paragraph rule as well as ensuring appropriate paragraph length is to think about paragraphs as a cup of T.E.A.
